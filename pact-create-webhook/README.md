# pact-create-webhook

This is a composite GitHub Action to instruct a Pact Broker to create a provider webhook.
The webhook is used to instruct the provider to verify the pact(s).

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

### Secrets

This action requires a GCP service account key with permissions to access secret payloads.
Once created, the JSON key should be `base64` encoded and added as secret in the GitHub repository.

It is recommended that the service account _only_ has permissions to access secrets. Do not allow modifications or
access to any other resources in your project.

### Webhook contents

The payload that the broker will populate before sending request to Github contains the following fields.
They can be used for misc functionality on the webhook job, reporting to Slack etc.

*(Note that this json is a subset of the body)*

```json
{
  "client_payload": {
    "pact-consumer": "${pactbroker.consumerName}",
    "pact-consumer-branch": "${pactbroker.consumerVersionBranch}",
    "pact-consumer-version": "${pactbroker.consumerVersionNumber}",
    "pact-provider": "${pactbroker.providerName}",
    "pact-provider-branch": "${pactbroker.providerVersionBranch}",
    "pact-provider-version": "${pactbroker.providerVersionNumber}",
    "pact-url": "${pactbroker.pactUrl}"
  }
}
```

### Examples

The following example shows how the action can be used in the pipeline to instruct the Pact Broker
to create the provider webhook.

```yaml
on: push

jobs:
  pact-create-webhook:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Create Pact Broker provider webhook
        uses: extenda/actions/pact-create-webhook@v0
        with:
          service-account-key: ${{ secrets.SECRET_AUTH }}
          application-name: my-application
          uuid: a-uuid-that-you-generate
```
