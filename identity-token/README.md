# identity-token

This is a GitHub Action to obtain a valid identity token for the specified account.

The action outputs the token as `identity-token` as well as an `IDENTITY_TOKEN` environment variable.

Note: This action can be executed only in the staging environment.

## Usage

See [action.yml](action.yml).

### Secrets

This action requires a GCP service account key with permission to deploy the cloud run services.
Once created, the JSON key should be `base64` encoded and added as secret in the GitHub repository.

### Examples

```yaml
